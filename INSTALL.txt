Requirements:

    If you have Python already installed, the stackless installer might replace
    the current version if they match but you can also have multiple versions of
    Python installed if you build it yourself.

    Stackless Python is an extension of the regular Python interpreter. Any 
    existing Python code will run with any modifications. Stackless simply
    adds some extra capabilities to regular Python.
